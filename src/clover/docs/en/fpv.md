# Installation of FPV

## Preparation of the FPV camera

1. Take the connector wire from the camera and cut off the BLACK side of the 3-pin connector.
1. Prepare the wire leads to be connected:
   1. Shorten the wires to the desired length *.
   1. Strip (remove 2 mm of insulation from the end of the wire without damaging the strands).
   1. Twist the wires.
   1. Blanch using tweezers.

\* The distance between the power distribution board and the estimated location of the camera should be determined in advance!

## Preparation of the transmitter

The same procedure applies here:

1. Take the connector wire from the transmitter and cut off the BLACK side of the 5-pin connector.
2. Prepare the wire leads to be connected:
   1. Shorten the wires to the desired length *.
   2. Strip (remove 2 mm of insulation from the end of the wire without damaging the strands).
   3. Twist the wires.
   4. Blanch using tweezers.

\* The distance between the power distribution board and the estimated location of the transmitter should be determined in advance!
